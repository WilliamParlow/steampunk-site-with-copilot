            <p>Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction or science fantasy that incorporates technology and aesthetic
                designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. It may be distinguished from the
                closely related neo-victorianism by the emphasis on anachronistic technology, and is often set in an
                alternative history of the 19th century in which steam power has maintained mainstream usage, or in a
                future history in which steam power has retroactively been invented.</p>
